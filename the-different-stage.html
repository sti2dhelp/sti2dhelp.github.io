            <h2>Those are the stages:</h2>
                <h3>I.</h3>
                <p class="text"><a class="plink" href="ds/first.html">Learning mechanics stage. The player figures out how inserters/belts/power/assembling machines work. <br>
                Goal: make a factory.</a></p>
                <h3>II.</h3>
                <p class="text"><a class="plink" href="ds/second.html">Learnings strategies and principles stage. The player figures out how to do things well. They design smelting, circuits and other "blueprints". They learn to not make sushi and to use more than one of each machine.<br>
                Goal: make a factory that you can leave alone without things breaking.</a></p>
                <h3>III.</h3>
                <p class="text"><a class="plink" href="ds/third.html">Intermediate stage. The player advances to the later sciences and learns how to use fluids/make expandable designs. They likely use trains for the first time. The player unlocks robots. <br>

                <h3>IV.</h3>
                <p class="text"><a class="plink" href="ds/fourth.html">The "beat the game" stage: the player "knows how to play", and tries to launch a rocket/get some achievements. The player might learn ratios or use calculators here if someone else didn't spoil things for them earlier. <br>
                Goal: beat the game.</a></p>
